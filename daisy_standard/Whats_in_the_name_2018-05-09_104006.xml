The primary goal of classical yoga is to bring
concentration and stillness to
the mind. A focused mind and a
peaceful and positive feeling, are vital requirements as well
as by-products of an effective
asana practice. Yoga should not
be for the body alone. Mental
focus as part of asana practice
is an entrée to the meditation
that follows the asanas. Without mental focus, asanas are
just an exercise for the body;
the mind is disengaged and
vagrant.
</p>
<p>
Such an asana practice will
not effectively lead to meditation. Practising the true aim of
yoga - to calm and control the
mind - does not require a
knowledge of Sanskrit. Being
familiar with many Sanskrit
names, such as those for yoga
postures does not, in and of itself, indicate that a person is
practising authentic yoga.
Proper understanding of the
principles and practice of yoga
is more important. The fundamentals of the practice of yoga
came to us many centuries ago
in the Sanskrit language. But
the methods and beneﬁts of the
practice transcend language
and culture.
</p>
<p>
This raises the issue of naming asanas in order to practise
them. The Caraka Samhita - the classical work on Ayurveda
(traditional Indian medicine) - advises the healer not to despair if a name cannot be assigned to every disorder
encountered; treatment can still be administered. As yoga practitioners and teachers, we can
follow this advice: “We do not
have to name each of the numerous variations of classical asanas, in Sanskrit or in any other
language, to practise them.”
</p>
<p>
Many variations of asanas
are easier practised or described

 than named — especially in Sanskrit. What's in a
name? Yoga poses are named in
various ways. Some are named
after animals and birds, some
describe the body's position in
an asana, and some are named
after mythological ﬁgures.
Some asanas are named after
ancient sages or derive from
mythology, with uplifting stories behind them. For instance,
Bharadvajasana is named after
the sage Bharadvaja; visvamitrasana is named after the sage Visvamitra.
</p>
<p>
Bhagiratasana is another. It
is widely known as “tree pose”
(vrkshasana). My guru, the legendary Yogi of the last century, T. Krishnamacharya used to
call the tree pose Bhagiratasana. Bhagirata was supposed to
have meditatedf for several
years standing on one leg!
Krishnamacharya used to say,
“When doing Bhagiratasana,
keep the great Bhagirata inmind. Bring tireless perseverance and steadfast concentration to your practice.”
</p>
<p>
Consider the warrior pose,
Virabhadrasana. This is an example of an asana name that
suggests the psychological feeling that can accompany the
practice. Virabhadrasana is an
assertive stance that can produce an energetic feeling.
While doing the warrior Vinyasa, Krishnamacharya recommended that we bring into our
mind a feeling like that of a
bird. This is particularly appropriate in the devotional tradition of Vaishnavism, in which a
principal devotee of the Divine,
in the form of Lord Narayana, is
depicted as an eagle named Garuda. The eagle Garuda also
functions as a vehicle, bearing
Narayana on his back. “As you
do the Virabhadrasana Vinyasa,” Krishnamacharya would say, “keep in mind that you are
in the service of the Divine. As
you extend your arms and look
down, bring the feeling that
you are above the world and its
various concerns but close to
the Divine.”
</p>
<p>
What if a practitioner has no
religious beliefs?

Still, the imagery is valuable.
Instead of thinking of the Divine, a practitioner can bring
the feeling that ‘I am Without
any fear or burden. I am not
troubled by the future or the
past, ﬂying above worldly pressures.’ In yoga, we work with
our minds to ensure that the internal results are in our hands.
