The unimaginably arid, empty, remote

scientists. </sent><sent id="dtb5" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp6">Murchison, 700 km north of

Square Kilometre Array (SKA).

collecting area.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp13" id="dtb11">When complete, the SKA Will be the world’s
biggest telescope with millions of square
metres of collecting area, and 50 times more
sensitive than today’s best. </sent><sent id="dtb12" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp14">“It’s not one huge
dish, it Will be thousands of radio antennas
spread over hundreds of kilometers and

Peter Hall, director, engineering at the
International Centre for Radio astronomy
Research (ICRAR), Perth. </sent><sent id="dtb13" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp15">The antennas

million 1.5 metre—high radio receivers.

or reduce the number of dishes. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp20" id="dtb17">It aims
to study the ‘cosmic dawn’ — or image the
Universe when the very ﬁrst stars were
beginning to form,” says Sarah Pearce,
deputy director of CSIRO’S Astronomy and
Space Science division.

(MRA) observatory. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp27" id="dtb23">MeerKAT’s 64 dishes
will eventually be integrated with the ﬁrst
phase of SKA involving 200 dishes in
South Africa and covering the 350 MHZ

to 14 GHZ range of the spectrum (SKAI
MID), says Diamond.

MWA, built by an international consortium
led by ICRAR and comprising research
institutions from Australia, India, New
Zealand and the US, has been operating for
the last three years. </sent><sent id="dtb25" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp29">The MWA telescope has
2048 antennas, split into 128 groups called
tiles. </sent><sent id="dtb26" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp30">Each tile has 16 spider—like structures
(4m X 4m) called dipoles. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp31" id="dtb27">The majority of
the tiles are placed in a core region 1.5 km
in diameter, and the rest distributed more
widely, as far as 3 km apart. </sent><sent id="dtb28" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp32">It can look
in many different directions at once and
survey large parts of the sky quickly to help
scientists observe spinning neutron stars

hemisphere, and see very faint sources of
radio waves.

</sent><sent id="dtb33" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp38">Subramanyam’s team at RRI landed in the
remote outback for this MWA. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp39" id="dtb34">RRI helped
design and build the MWA’s receivers
that pick up signals from the antennas,
process them using complex high—speed
algorithms, and transmit the data Via
optical ﬁbres to a central processing
unit, where the imaging information is
computed.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp40" id="dtb35">RRI is also engaged with India’s Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) near
Pune, recognised as a ‘pathﬁnder’ telescope
— not part of the SKA site but contributing
to the SKA’s technology. </sent><sent id="dtb36" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp41">NCRA is working
on the design of the ‘Telescope Manager’
(TM) that Will control the humongous
amount of data from the various antennae,
and convert human instructions into
machine instructions to ensure that the
telescope points in the exact direction
needed, says Yashwant Gupta, scientist at
the National Centre for Radio Astronomy
(NCRA), Pune and head of the SKA—India
Consortium. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp42" id="dtb37">Indian scientists are also part
of the scientiﬁc working groups of SKA.

observatory, as it receives signals from all
systems of the observatory and coordinates
and synchronises its operations,” says
Gupta.

</sent><sent id="dtb40" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp46">An SKA-India consortium set up in
February 2015, comprising astronomy
research institutes, astronomy departments
of a few universities and industry partners,
is currently identifying areas that “Indian
astronomers are traditionally good at and
areas that India would like to work on in
the future,” says Gupta. </sent><sent id="dtb41" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp47">The TM is working
on the detailed design expected to be ready
by August 2017. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp48" id="dtb42">Construction is expected
to begin by mid—2018.

</sent><sent id="dtb43" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp49">As a spinoff, India’s leading role in the TM
is helping the country upgrade the GMRT,
operating since the 905. </sent><sent id="dtb44" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp50">It has 30 antennas
working in ﬁve low frequency radio bands
(100 to 1500 MHZ). </sent><sent id="dtb45" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp51">“The NCRA will test
signiﬁcant aspects of the SKA Telescope
Manager design on its upgraded GMRT,”
says Gupta.

</sent><sent id="dtb46" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp52">All these mammoth efforts are in the
quest of the ‘cosmic dawn’ or ‘epoch of
reionisation’ when the ﬁrst light began
to shine, and to help understand what
the Universe looked like when stars and
galaxies started forming.
