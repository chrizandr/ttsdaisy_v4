European Community and USA.

</sent><sent id="dtb11" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp15">“Now there is hope for these patients,”
says Balu Manohar, the company’s CEO.
</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp16" id="dtb12">Its ﬂagship product “stempeucel” —
patented in the US, Japan, China and
Malaysia — is derived from allogeneic
pooled mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC),
extracted from the bone marrow of adult
voluntary donors.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp17" id="dtb13">“This is the ﬁrst allogeneic MSC
transplantation study in India,” Manohar
said adding that the pooling technology
developed is also novel and has been
patented.

</sent><sent id="dtb14" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp18">The DCGI approval for “stempeucel” is
based on clinical data generated in phase-l
and phase—Z trials on 90 subjects With

signiﬁcant improvement in blood ﬂow is
observed compared to placebo or control
group of patient,” Manohar said.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp22" id="dtb17">Although it is too early to say
if Stempeucel would improve amputation —
free survival in these patients, the clinical
data suggests that disease progression has
been halted and clinical improvement
observed in several parameters, he said.
</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp23" id="dtb18">“This improvement is consistent for a period
of 6 months follow up of these patients.”

</sent><sent id="dtb19" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp24">Under DCGI’S limited approval,
Stempeutics can manufacture and sell its
product to 200 patients on a cost recovery
basis (limited to Rupees 150000 or $2200)
per patient and submit the data to DCGI’S
ofﬁce before seeking full marketing
authorization. </sent><sent id="dtb20" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp25">“They have given us a time
window of two years,” Manohar said. </sent><sent id="dtb21" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp26">“Our

goal is to complete the study on 200 patients
and seek full marketing authorisation by the
end of next year.”

</sent><sent id="dtb23" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp29">“This is a huge win for patients, for
Stempeutics, and for the ﬁeld of MSC
therapy,” Jeffrey Karp, Associate Professor
of Medicine at Harvard Medical School
who is also in the company’s advisory board
told Nature India. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp30" id="dtb24">“Also, we must commend
the Indian regulators for promoting
regenerative medicine for major unmet
medical needs.”

</sent><sent id="dtb25" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp31">Stempeutics is working to globalise its
product, which has already been granted
the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product
and Orphan Drug Designation status by
European Medicinal Agency. </sent><sent id="dtb26" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp32">“This will help
us fast-track commercialisation in Europe,”
said Manohar.
