The more interesting ﬁnding for the
scientists was the occurrence of several
hundreds of ‘boulder falls’ very near those
young faults, where the boulders rolled,
tumbled and jumped along the slopes,
leaving many trails or tracks on their way.

young, are potential indicators of recent
ground shaking and seismic activity on the

examine the Apollo seismic observations to
conﬁrm if these events were indeed due to
meteorite impacts, as interpreted by NASA,

also provide new insights about mechanism
of earthquakes, Kumar said adding that
ISRO’s Moon rover in the Chandrayaan-II
mission slated for 2017 should, therefore,
carry a seismometer to study these activities
in the Schrodinger basin.
