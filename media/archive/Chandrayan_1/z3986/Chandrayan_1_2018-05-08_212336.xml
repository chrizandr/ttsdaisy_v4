India’s Chandrayaan-l mission to the Moon has helped discover the
most likely locations of “shallow”

moonquakes that resemble those on
Earth, scientists report.

recorded thousands of deep moonquakes,
hundreds of surface quakes due to meteorite
impacts and very few shallow moonquakes
every year.

</sent><sent id="dtb11" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp15">Since the discovery of these “shallow”
quakes, many researchers attempted to
locate their sources without much success.
</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp16" id="dtb12">Kumar and co—workers from institutions
under the Indian Space Research
Organization (ISRO) used images obtained
by Chandrayaan-l high—resolution terrain
mapping camera and the Narrow Angle
Camera of NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter that was launched in 2009. </sent><sent id="dtb13" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp17">“We
report new occurrences of very young
thrust faults — similar to those that cause
earthquakes in the Himalayan range — at
four different locations in the 320—km
diameter Schrédinger basin near the lunar
south pole that was created by an asteroid
impact about 3.8 billion years ago,” Kumar
said.

</sent><sent id="dtb14" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp18">These faults, just a few tens to hundreds
of meters deep, are known as ‘lobate scarps’
— because of their ‘topographic bump’
— and are believed to have been formed
when the lunar crust was pushed together
as the Moon contracted. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp19" id="dtb15">The researchers
dated these faults using a well-proven age
determination method (crater counting)
and found them to be surprisingly young,
the youngest being only 10 million years

old. </sent><sent id="dtb17" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp22">“The young age of the fault scarps
indicates that the Moon has contracted
very recently,” Kumar said. </sent><sent id="dtb18" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp23">On Earth, this
type of faults are usually associated With
repeated seismic activities. </sent><sent id="dtb19" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp24">“Whether the
lobate scarps on the Moon are seismically
active presently or were only in the past is
unknown,” Kumar said. </sent><sent id="dtb20" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp25">By mapping the
distribution and determining the size of
the newly detected and previously known
‘lobate scarps’, the tectonic and thermal
history of the Moon can be reconstructed
over the past billion years, he said.

The more interesting ﬁnding for the
scientists was the occurrence of several
hundreds of ‘boulder falls’ very near those
young faults, where the boulders rolled,
tumbled and jumped along the slopes,
leaving many trails or tracks on their way.
</sent><sent id="dtb22" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp28">“These boulder tracks that are also very
young, are potential indicators of recent
ground shaking and seismic activity on the
Moon,” Kumar said.

</sent><sent id="dtb23" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp29">The new observations of youthful ‘lobate
scarps’ and abundant boulder falls on
nearby slopes in the Schrodinger basin have
important implications for seismotectonics
and mass wasting processes on the Moon.
</sent><sent id="dtb24" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp30">The study also suggests the need to re—
examine the Apollo seismic observations to
conﬁrm if these events were indeed due to
meteorite impacts, as interpreted by NASA,
or due to shallow moonquakes in the
Schrodinger basin. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp31" id="dtb25">The moonquakes may
also provide new insights about mechanism
of earthquakes, Kumar said adding that
ISRO’s Moon rover in the Chandrayaan-II
mission slated for 2017 should, therefore,
carry a seismometer to study these activities
in the Schrodinger basin.
