A new study exploring the genetic
history of present—day Indians,
reconstructed using DNA
information, has found they are descendants

of four major ancestral populations in
mainland Indial.

National Institute of Biomedical Genomics
(NIBG) in Kalyani, West Bengal, report

inference2 by an international team that
present-day Indians are derived from
only two ancestral stocks of people —
one ancestral to all north Indians and,
the other, ancestral to all south Indians.

of genomic data representing hundreds of
people worldwide — to derive ancestral
inferences about Indians, “the entire study
was conducted in India by researchers of
a single Indian institution,” he said adding
that it has been able to provide robust
evidence that four — not two —— ancestral
stocks contributed to the genetic diversity
of present—day Indians.

               <a href="speechgen0002.smil#text16">These ancestral stocks are roughly
identiﬁable with the four language families
in India — Indo-European (north India),
Dravidian (south India), Tibeto-Burman
(north—east India) and Austro—Asiatic
(fragmented in east and central India;
spoken exclusively by the tribal).

group themselves in relatively—isolated
social groups, with negligible proportion
of marriages taking place between
individuals belonging to different social
groups, this situation did not prevail in the
past, says Majumder.

exchange was widespread among the

               <a href="speechgen0002.smil#text19">This practice of inter-
marriage was rapidly replaced by strict
endogamy marriage within upper-caste
Indo-European speakers leading to the
formation of endogamous groups — that
is, groups whose members marry only
within their groups but not outside.

that the transition in India from free
intermarriage to endogamy took place
about 70 generations or about 1600
years ago,” Majumder said. </a>

transformation took place — notably
the enforcement of social strictures
