A new study exploring the genetic
history of present—day Indians,
reconstructed using DNA
information, has found they are descendants

of four major ancestral populations in
mainland Indial.

</sent><sent id="dtb5" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp6">Partha Majumder and co-workers at the
National Institute of Biomedical Genomics
(NIBG) in Kalyani, West Bengal, report
that their ﬁnding contrasts With an earlier
inference2 by an international team that
present-day Indians are derived from
only two ancestral stocks of people —
one ancestral to all north Indians and,
the other, ancestral to all south Indians.
</sent><sent id="dtb6" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp7">The NIBG team has now discovered two
more ancestries — Austro-Asiatic and
Tibeto-Burman. </sent><sent id="dtb7" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp8">In addition, the authors
identiﬁed a ﬁfth ancestral lineage that is
dominant among the Iarawa and Onge
tribal of Andaman and Nicobar Islands,

also ancestral to the present-day Paciﬁc
Islanders.

</sent><sent id="dtb8" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp9">“The study was done using judiciously
selected populations who provide a
more complete representation of Indians
resident of diverse geo—cultural ecosystems
of India, and also using about double the
number of DNA variants per individual
than the previous major study,” Majumder
told Nature India.

</sent><sent id="dtb9" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp10">The researchers said they systematically
explored DNA variation in about 400
unrelated Indians belonging to 20 ethnic
groups including two Negrito tribal groups
residing in the Andaman and Nicobar
islands. </sent><sent id="dtb10" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp11">The remaining 18 groups — both
tribal and caste groups — are from mainland
India. </sent><sent id="dtb11" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp12">While studies have been conducted
in the past by various groups, “this is the
largest DNA variation study conducted in
India, taking into account both the number
of ethnic groups and the number of DNA
variants (over 1 million) examined on each
individual,” Majumder said.

available data from the Human Genome

of genomic data representing hundreds of
people worldwide — to derive ancestral
inferences about Indians, “the entire study
was conducted in India by researchers of
a single Indian institution,” he said adding
that it has been able to provide robust
evidence that four — not two —— ancestral
stocks contributed to the genetic diversity
of present—day Indians.

</sent><sent id="dtb14" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp16">These ancestral stocks are roughly
identiﬁable with the four language families
in India — Indo-European (north India),
Dravidian (south India), Tibeto-Burman
(north—east India) and Austro—Asiatic
(fragmented in east and central India;
spoken exclusively by the tribal).

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp17" id="dtb15">Although present-day Indians largely
group themselves in relatively—isolated
social groups, with negligible proportion
of marriages taking place between
individuals belonging to different social
groups, this situation did not prevail in the
past, says Majumder.

</sent><sent id="dtb16" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp18">“Our analysis showed that gene
exchange was widespread among the
four ancestral groups of the present—
day Indians, suggesting that difference
in social position was not a major bar to
marriage,” he said. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp19" id="dtb17">This practice of inter-
marriage was rapidly replaced by strict
endogamy marriage within upper-caste
Indo-European speakers leading to the
formation of endogamous groups — that
is, groups whose members marry only
within their groups but not outside.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp20" id="dtb18">“Our study, using DNA data, estimated
that the transition in India from free
intermarriage to endogamy took place
about 70 generations or about 1600
years ago,” Majumder said. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp21" id="dtb19">The timing,
he said, coincides with the period of the
of the Gupta empire when a lot of social
transformation took place — notably
the enforcement of social strictures
against marriage between castes —
that resulted in a shift to endogamy,
the authors said. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp22" id="dtb20">The researchers say

the populations of India may have been
underestimated by previous researchers
because of lack of inclusion of tribal
populations and inadequate representation
of the geocultural diversity of India in the
set of sampled populations.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp25" id="dtb22">“Our study has corrected this deﬁciency
and has provided a more robust
explanation of the genomic diversities and
afﬁnities among extant populations of the
Indian subcontinent, elucidating in ﬁner
detail the peopling of the region.”

</sent><sent id="dtb23" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp26">Ramasamy Pitchappan, an expert in
human genomics and director of research
at Chettinad University in Tamil Nadu
says the ﬁnding is not new. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp27" id="dtb24">“Most of the
observations reported in this work overlap
with facts earlier published3 by us.”
