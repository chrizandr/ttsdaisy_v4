</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp13" id="dtb12">It brought her to Mary Wigman’s
school in Dresden, in pre-War Europe and this training in Eurythmics helped her teach later what
became a part of Indian modern
dance. </sent><sent id="dtb13" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp14">Wigman told her, "Please,
whatever you do, don't imitate us:
