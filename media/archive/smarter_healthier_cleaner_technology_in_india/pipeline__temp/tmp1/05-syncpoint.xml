Over the last three years,
India’s Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has imparted a
new impetus to developments
in modern biology and biotechnology, shaping its programmes
in line with the National
Biotechnology Development
Strategy 2015-2020.

</sent><sent smil:sync="true">This strategy is the result of
formal and informa| consultations with more than 300 stake-holder groups. </sent><sent smil:sync="true">It includes four
major missions on education,
healthcare, food and nutrition,
and clean energy. </sent><sent smil:sync="true">It has driven
technology development and,
with global partnerships, five
new bioclusters, 40 biotech incubators, 150 technology transfer offices and 20 Bio-Connect
Centres. </sent><sent smil:sync="true">The strategy has helped establish the Life Sciences and
Biotechnology Education Council for strategic and focused
investment in building human
capital. </sent><sent smil:sync="true">Below are some examples of the strategic initiatives
established by the DBT.

</sent><sent smil:sync="true">The DBT established a Regional Centre for Biotechnology
under the auspices of United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) and declared it to
be an institution of national
importance. </sent><sent smil:sync="true">The centre will
undertake research and training
in biotechnology and other

hub of technology expertise.

</sent><sent smil:sync="true">The DBT and PrakashLab,
Stanford University, <acronym pronounce="no" title="United States of America">USA</acronym> have
joined forces to offer Foldscope,
a US$1 paper microscope, to
the most resource—constrained
schools and colleges in India

in an attempt to democratize
curiosity—driven science.

</sent><sent smil:sync="true">A student-exchange program
between the DBT and the
British Council has allowed

65 PhD students from India
and 17 PhD students from the
<acronym pronounce="no" title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> to experience research in a
different culture.

</sent><sent smil:sync="true">India became an associate
member of the European
Molecular Biology Organisation
(EMBO). </sent><sent smil:sync="true">This allows |ndian
scientists to submit proposals
to the EMBO to hold meetings
and workshops in India, thereby
providing training and learning
opportunities to students on an
unprecedented scale. </sent><sent smil:sync="true">Indian scientists can also apply to become
EMBO Young Investigators and
Indian students and scientists
can compete for EMBO shortand Iong-term fellowships,
thereby entering into globally
competitive high-end research.

in advanced biotechnology for
more than 450 young scientists. </sent><sent smil:sync="true">Every year, approximately
80 projects under this flagship
programme are being supported. </sent><sent smil:sync="true">Mid-career researchers
were recognized in 2015—2016
through 12 Units of Excellence
in Biotechnology (U-Excel) and
a Centre of the Institute for
Bioresources and Sustainable
Development will be opened
and 50 small—scale Biotech labs
will be established in Arunachal
Pradesh. </sent><sent smil:sync="true">Meanwhile the Overseas Associateship for NER
scientists aims to promote capacity building in cutting-edge
areas of biotechnology and life
sciences with 110 scientists
taking up the associateship.

</sent><sent smil:sync="true">The Nobel Prize Series is a
unique programme combining
conference, lectures, round
tables, and exhibitions with
Nobe| laureates, other experts,
researchers and students. </sent><sent smil:sync="true">It
includes a unique exhibition
with exhibits brought from the
Nobel Museum, Sweden. </sent><sent smil:sync="true">The
series will be in India from 2017 to 2022.
