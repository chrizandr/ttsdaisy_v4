Over the last three years,
India’s Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has imparted a
new impetus to developments
in modern biology and biotechnology, shaping its programmes
in line with the National
Biotechnology Development
Strategy 2015-2020.

This strategy is the result of
formal and informa| consultations with more than 300 stake-holder groups. It includes four
major missions on education,
healthcare, food and nutrition,
and clean energy. It has driven
technology development and,
with global partnerships, five
new bioclusters, 40 biotech incubators, 150 technology transfer offices and 20 Bio-Connect
Centres. The strategy has helped establish the Life Sciences and
Biotechnology Education Council for strategic and focused
investment in building human
capital. Below are some examples of the strategic initiatives
established by the DBT.

The DBT established a Regional Centre for Biotechnology
under the auspices of United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) and declared it to
be an institution of national
importance. The centre will
undertake research and training
in biotechnology and other

</p>

				<p>
    
scientific disciplines, creating a
hub of technology expertise.

The DBT and PrakashLab,
Stanford University, USA have
joined forces to offer Foldscope,
a US$1 paper microscope, to
the most resource—constrained
schools and colleges in India

in an attempt to democratize
curiosity—driven science.

A student-exchange program
between the DBT and the
British Council has allowed

65 PhD students from India
and 17 PhD students from the
UK to experience research in a
different culture.

India became an associate
member of the European
Molecular Biology Organisation
(EMBO). This allows |ndian
scientists to submit proposals
to the EMBO to hold meetings
and workshops in India, thereby
providing training and learning
opportunities to students on an
unprecedented scale. Indian scientists can also apply to become
EMBO Young Investigators and
Indian students and scientists
can compete for EMBO shortand Iong-term fellowships,
thereby entering into globally
competitive high-end research.

The Twinning Programme in
North East India has supported nearly 400 RnD projects,
leading to more than 200

</p>

				<p>
    
papers published in peer-re-viewed journals, and training
in advanced biotechnology for
more than 450 young scientists. Every year, approximately
80 projects under this flagship
programme are being supported. Mid-career researchers
were recognized in 2015—2016
through 12 Units of Excellence
in Biotechnology (U-Excel) and
a Centre of the Institute for
Bioresources and Sustainable
Development will be opened
and 50 small—scale Biotech labs
will be established in Arunachal
Pradesh. Meanwhile the Overseas Associateship for NER
scientists aims to promote capacity building in cutting-edge
areas of biotechnology and life
sciences with 110 scientists
taking up the associateship.

The Nobel Prize Series is a
unique programme combining
conference, lectures, round
tables, and exhibitions with
Nobe| laureates, other experts,
researchers and students. It
includes a unique exhibition
with exhibits brought from the
Nobel Museum, Sweden. The
series will be in India from 2017 to 2022.

India is today a leading
vaccine manufacturing hub,
The Vaccine Grand Challenge
Programme aims to encourage novel and innovative
vaccine-related discoveries
and accelerated development
of candidate vaccines. For
example, a malaria vaccine is
under toxicology assessment
(JAIVAC 2) and a vaccine for
vivax malaria has completed
phaseltriaI(JAIVAC1).

The International Centre
for Genetic Engineering and
Biotechnology (ICGEB) is
collaborating with drug major
Sun Pharma to use the recombinant EDIlI-based sub-unit
dengue vaccine candidate to
develop an injectable vaccine
that protects against all four
dengue strains endemic to
India. The collaboration is also
working towards developing a
phytopharmaceutical drug.

India is the chair of the
interim board of the Coalition
for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations (CEPI), a new global alliance among governments,
industries, academia, philanthropy, inter-governmental
institutions, the World Health
Organization and civil society.

Stem cell research was identified as an area for developing

collaborative programmes
between Japan and India during
a recent state visit. The focus
is on developing treatments
for sickle cell anemia, beta-thal-assemia and brain disorders as
well as creating a Haplobank
relevant to the Indian population in collaboration with CiRA,
Kyoto University, Japan.

The Pre-term Birth Program
is the first inter-institutional
programme on maternal infant
health in India with funding
of INR488.5 million (US$7.5
million). It aims to enhance
knowledge of the underlying
pathophysiological mechanisms
of preterm birth.

The Gates Foundation is
helping to install 100 bio-toilets
to demonstrate the sanitation
technology in North East India.
Reinvent the Toilet Challenge
— India for developing proof—of—concept research in waste man-agement was also supported.

In a joint statement issued
by the two governments,
the prime ministers of the
United Kingdom and India

task of decoding the 17,000 million bases in the wheat genome.
Indian scientists participated by
decoding chromosome 2A.

Brucella Free Villages is a
pilot programme involving 50
villages in 10 states. Brucellosis
is bacterial zoonotic disease
that causes economic losses of
about INR 280 billion (US$4.3
billion) per year. Participants
from 26 countries deliberated
on brucellosis challenges in a
recent international conference
organized by DBT in collaboration with the Indian Council of
Agricultural Research, at which
three new brucella diagnostic
kits were launched.

DBT and the Netherlands
government have agreed to
collaborate on a proposal
called Local Treatment of
Urban Sewage Streams for
Healthy Reuse (LOTUS).
Launched at the Barapullah
drain, the project aims to
demonstrate a novel holistic
(waste-) water management
approach that will produce
clean water that can be reused
for industry, agriculture and
construction, while

collaboration in biotechnology”,
and announced joint initiatives
on anti-microbial resistance
with joint investment of up

to £13 million; innovative
biotechnology for cleaning and
processing industrial waste,
with funding worth £16 million;
and women’s and children’s
health in low-income settings,
with £12.6 million invested.

The India Bio-design Program has developed innovative
technologies for day-to—day
patient use such as an ostomy
management device; an emergency medical alert device;
a breathable and customized
cast for immobilizing fractured
limbs; a fluid—extraction device;
and a posture-support device.

A strong science—farmer
platform is the aim of a new
farmer-centric programme.
The Biotech—KISAN scheme
will demonstrate and scale—up programmes addressing
water, soil, seed and marketing
issues of local farmers with
validated technologies.

Some 15 countries have joined
forces to complete the huge

simultaneously recovering nutrients and
energy from the urban waste
water, thus converting drain
into profitable mines.

Indigenous processing
technology and a pilot—sca|e
manufacturing unit for ironfortified rice has been developed
through DBT support at IIT,
Kharagpur to address anemia.
The plant can process 100
kilograms of rice in 8 hours.

The first indigenous
technology has been developed
for commercial production of
ethanol from lignocellulosic
waste at the DBT-ICT Centre,
Mumbai. The demonstration
plant, at IGL, Kashipur, can
proces 10 tonnes of biomass
per day to produce 3,000
litres of ethanol per day on a
continuous basis. I
