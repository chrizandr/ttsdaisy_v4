AN OBSESSION WITH TIME

anmm' and 1 quarrelled because she would not let me
sink ha makeshift boat in the marsh pnnl, in which a ﬁne
steep sea could be worked up by hand in a Few seconds,
More exactly, I quarrelled wilh Margaret about it,for my
sister always remained passive in the many disagreements
we had when I was getting on for eleven and she was hine‘
It is hard, as it always is with vivid childish memories, to
know how much of the incidcnt is rcccucctcd from the
time ofiu happening, and how many suitable details the
mind has added aftermrds in reconstrucﬁon. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp17" id="dtb15">The whole
lriv'ialuccurrcncesccnu clear in retrospect, hm so objectively
seen that it might be happening in any two other damp and
dirty shrill-voiccd children, playing on a sm’p or marsh
ground much bigger than I now know it to be. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp18" id="dtb16">The Lallic
