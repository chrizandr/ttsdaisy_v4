only going through the motion of engaging

its members have conﬂict of interest.»

cleared for commercial cultivation by the
GEAC only to be over-ruled by the then
Environment Minister Iairam Ramesh.

the states have to follow suit.

Padmanabhan “would be to make GM
mustard available to farmers and they will

ﬁnd out in no time whether it is worth
taking it forward.”

hara Mustard Hybrid-ll (DMH-
Dll) might become India’s ﬁrst
genetically modiﬁed (GM) food
crop released for cultivation by regulators

Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee

(GEAC), if there’s no public resistance to its
launch.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp23" id="dtb20">University of Delhi scientists developed
the GM mustard hybrid variety Brassica
juncea close to a decade back and
demonstrated that it produces 38% more
yield as opposed to control varieties.

GM activists, who are opposed to the

introduction of the hybrid citing safety
reasons.

</sent><sent id="dtb22" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp25">But a 7-member sub-committee set up
by India’s, Ministry of Environment and
Forests (MoEF) has sought to put the
controversy to rest and recommended its
clearance. </sent><sent id="dtb23" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp26">After studying data provided by

its developers, the committee declared this
week that DMH-ll and its parental lines

“do not raise any public health and safety
concern for human beings and does not
pose any threat to biodiversity.”

</sent><sent id="dtb24" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp27">Complying with the request of the Central
Information Commissioner, the ministry
has put the sub-committee’s 133— page

invited public commentsl. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp28" id="dtb25">The GEAC will
take the ﬁnal decision on GM mustard,
