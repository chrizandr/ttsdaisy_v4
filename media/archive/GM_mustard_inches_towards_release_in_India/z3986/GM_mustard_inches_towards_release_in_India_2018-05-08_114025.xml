GEAC, agrees. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp6" id="dtb5">“The issue of GM—mustard
has turned out to be extremely important
for the country and people should be taken
into conﬁdence,” he said. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp7" id="dtb6">“The GEAC is
only going through the motion of engaging
With the public and is not serious,” he
told Nature India pointing out that «most of
its members have conﬂict of interest.»

</sent><sent id="dtb7" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp8">Presently, Bt cotton is the only GM crop
allowed for commercial cultivation in India
and GM mustard may face hurdles even
if cleared by GEAC after its engagement
with the public. </sent><sent id="dtb8" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp9">In 2010, Bt brinjal was
cleared for commercial cultivation by the
GEAC only to be over-ruled by the then
Environment Minister Iairam Ramesh.

the states have to follow suit.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp11" id="dtb10">“The best way to resolve the issue,” says
Padmanabhan “would be to make GM
mustard available to farmers and they will

ﬁnd out in no time whether it is worth
taking it forward.”

GM route is a platform—technology, where
by a whole new generation of (mustard)
hybrids, introducing newer characteristics
can be done as never before,” Padmanabhan
said.

Nature India. </sent><sent id="dtb14" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp16">“They should have put out
the biosafety data for independent scientiﬁc

(that GM mustard is safe),” she said.

(Assessment of Food and Environmental
Safety) put out in the website is not the

lack of seriousness about rigorous scientiﬁc
scrutiny of the data.” </sent><sent id="dtb17" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp19">If the feedback process
has to be really meaningful the entire
biosafety dossier —— not an abridged version
—— should be uploaded and at least 90 days’

time should be given for comments from
public,” she said.

hara Mustard Hybrid-ll (DMH-
Dll) might become India’s ﬁrst
genetically modiﬁed (GM) food
crop released for cultivation by regulators

Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee

(GEAC), if there’s no public resistance to its
launch.

</sent><sent id="dtb20" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp23">University of Delhi scientists developed
the GM mustard hybrid variety Brassica
juncea close to a decade back and
demonstrated that it produces 38% more
yield as opposed to control varieties.
</sent><sent id="dtb21" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp24">Ever since, they have been ﬁghting anti-
GM activists, who are opposed to the

introduction of the hybrid citing safety
reasons.

</sent><sent id="dtb22" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp25">But a 7-member sub-committee set up
by India’s, Ministry of Environment and
Forests (MoEF) has sought to put the
controversy to rest and recommended its
clearance. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp26" id="dtb23">After studying data provided by

its developers, the committee declared this
week that DMH-ll and its parental lines

“do not raise any public health and safety
concern for human beings and does not
pose any threat to biodiversity.”

</sent><sent id="dtb24" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp27">Complying with the request of the Central
Information Commissioner, the ministry
has put the sub-committee’s 133— page
“Safety Assessment Report” online and
invited public commentsl. </sent><sent id="dtb25" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp28">The GEAC will
take the ﬁnal decision on GM mustard,

keeping in mind, feedback received before
October 5, 2016.

Padmanabhan, a biochemist at the

Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru
told Nature India. </sent><sent id="dtb27" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp30">“I only hope the GM
