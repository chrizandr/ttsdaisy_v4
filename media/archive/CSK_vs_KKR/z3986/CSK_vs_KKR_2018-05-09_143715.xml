Shubman Gill, part of the triumphant India under—19
World Cup team, showed
glimpses of his potential
when he guided. </sent><sent id="dtb5" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp6">Kolkata
Knight Riders to a morale-boosting six—wicket victory
over Chennai Super Kings in
their Vivo-IPL contest at the
Eden Gardens on Thursday.

</sent><sent id="dtb6" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp7">Gill enthralled the packed
house, equally divided in
purple and yellow patches,
with his poise and control as
he played a crucial knock of
36-ball 57.and contributed in
a match-winning unbroken
partnership of 83 runs off 36
deliveries with captain Dinesh Karthik, who, raced to
45 off 18 balls.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp8" id="dtb7">KKR’s ﬁfth win, achieved
with 14 balls to spare, propelled it to the third spot. </sent><sent id="dtb8" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp9">A
Knight Riders’ chase did
not have an ideal start as
Chris Lynn and Robin Uthappa were dismissed early. </sent><sent id="dtb9" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp10">Sunil Narine, who was dropped
by Ravindra Jadeja off consecutive deliveries from K.M.
</sent><sent id="dtb10" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp11">Asif, notched up a characteristic 20-ball 32.

</sent><sent id="dtb11" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp12">The 18-year-old Gill started brilliantly, hitting Watson
for three fours in an over, but
displayed patience when
KKR was four down far 97 in

the 12th over. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp15" id="dtb13">The Punjab
batsman, who added 33 with
Rinku Singh,,batted with maturity and switched gears at
the right time to ﬂay the CSK
bowlers.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp16" id="dtb14">Gill pulled and cut Asif for
three sixes in the 15th over
and hit two fours off Jadeja in
the next to get his maiden
half-century.

</sent><sent id="dtb15" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp17">Earlier, CSK had a ﬂying
start, thanks'to some clinical hitting by the accomplished
opening duo of Shane Watson and Faf du Plessis.

</sent><sent id="dtb16" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp18">CSK’s run glut continued
even after du Plessis was
done in by a wrong ’un from
Piyush Chawla. </sent><sent id="dtb17" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp19">Watson, who

Andre Russell for two fours
each on either side of the
wicket, made merry.

</sent><sent id="dtb19" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp22">However, KKR fought
back in the middle overs as
Narine and Kuldeep mixed
precision with variety, while
Shivam Mavi bowled impressively. </sent><sent id="dtb20" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp23">Watson pulled Narine
straight to the mid-wicket
boundary and Raina played
Kuldeep to long-on in successive overs, putting the skids
on the Chennai team

Dhoni, who was let oﬂ by
Gill on the square-leg boundary off Kuldeep on 29,
scored an unbeaten 43 off 25
balls, underscoring his value
as a ﬁnisher, as the team ﬁnished at 177 for ﬁve.
