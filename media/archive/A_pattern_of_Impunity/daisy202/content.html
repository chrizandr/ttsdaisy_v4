der the SC/ST Act, it laid down '
three guidelines that nullify key
provisions of this law: it removed
the bar on grant of anticipatory
bail; even though the Mahajan
case only concerns public ser-
vvants, it ruled that where the ac-
cuSed is a non-public servant, the
police may make an arrest only af- a
ter "approval by a senior superin-
tendent of police; and it held that
before registering an FIR, the pol-
ice may conduct a preliminary in-
quiry to ascertain the veracity of
the complaint.

doubt the Dalit and investigate her
complaint for veracity, and what’ 5
