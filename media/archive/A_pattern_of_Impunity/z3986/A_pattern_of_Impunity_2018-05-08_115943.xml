For India's Dalits and Adivasis, May 1 this year was a ‘May

victirnised by false complaints un-
der the SC/ST Act, it laid down '
three guidelines that nullify key
provisions of this law: it removed
the bar on grant of anticipatory
bail; even though the Mahajan
case only concerns public ser-
vvants, it ruled that where the ac-
cuSed is a non-public servant, the
police may make an arrest only af- a
ter "approval by a senior superin-
tendent of police; and it held that
before registering an FIR, the pol-
ice may conduct a preliminary in-
quiry to ascertain the veracity of
the complaint.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp47" id="dtb43">Setback for SC/STs

Taken together, the three changes
neatly reverse the original man-
date of the SC/ST Act: instead of
immediately registering an FIR
and investigating the accused, the
police would now immediately
doubt the Dalit and investigate her
complaint for veracity, and what’ 5
more, they are required to do so
by law.

</sent><sent id="dtb44" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp48">One might assume that special
guidelines to curb false allegations
would be sparked bya case where.
false allegations have been pro-

ed along with the Central govern-
ment’s review petition. . '

By far the most disturbing 55- I
pect of the court’s order is the idea ‘
that poor conviction rates and
high acquittal rates suggest a high
number of false cases. </sent><sent id="dtb56" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp61">Can we ap-
ply this logic, say, to the acquittals
of all the accused in the Kilvenma-
, ni massacre (Tamil Nadu, 1968, 44
Dalits killed), Tsunduru massacre
(Andhra Pradesh, 1991, eight Dalits =
killed), Bathani Tola massacre (Bi-
har, 1996, 21 Dalits killed), Lax-
manpur-Bathe massacre (Bihar,
1997, 58 Dalits killed), Shankar-
bigha massacre (Bihar, 1999, 23
Dalits killed), “to mention just a few
of the most infamous instances of
mass acquittals? </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp62" id="dtb57">Do these acquit-
tals mean that the cases against
the accused were false? </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp63" id="dtb58">Or do they
suggest a pattern of bona ﬁde im-
punity for crimes against the Sche-
duled Castes?

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp64" id="dtb59">The 'SC/ST Act and the SC/ST '
Amendment Act hold enormous *
signiﬁcance for’ Dalits not because
they have been effective in pro~
tecting them from caste injustice;
not at all. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp65" id="dtb60">If they are cherished des-
pite their poor conviction rates
and shoddy implementation, it is ’
because their very existence is a
testament to Dalit agency in a hea- '
vily casteist society, and a power-
ful afﬁrmation of the community’s
_ faith in the Indian Constitution.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp66" id="dtb61">The problem with this law is not
its supposed misuse but the inabil-
ity of India’s criminal justice sys-
tem to recognise its own caSteist
biases. </sent><sent id="dtb62" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp67">It is, after all, ‘a matter of
common sense "that in a society
seeped in caste, 110 institution can
claim immunity from casteist pre-
judices or mindset. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp68" id="dtb63">Sadly, the ju'd- '
iciary has been reluctant to ack- .
nowledge the social matrix of
jurisprudence in India, which is
caste. '
