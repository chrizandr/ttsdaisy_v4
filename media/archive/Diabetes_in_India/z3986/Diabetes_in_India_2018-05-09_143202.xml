Access to life-saving insulin for
India’s nearly 60 million diabetics
is far lower than the World Health
Organization’s target of 80% says a new
study.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp6" id="dtb5">For a country that is rushing to become
the world’s diabetic capital, this should be
a matter of “serious public health concern,”
warn Abhishek Sharma and Warren
Kaplan, authors of the study form the
Boston University School of Public Health
in the US.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp7" id="dtb6">They are the ﬁrst to analyze insulin
availability in India’s private sector that
caters to majority of diabetes patients, who
are forced to spend from their pockets due
to thefailure of national programmes to
provide free health-care facilities.

</sent><sent id="dtb7" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp8">Unaffordable prices, excessive
dependence on foreign-made insulin and
an unholy nexus between Indian doctors
and foreign manufacturers that force
patients to buy expensive insulins instead
of cheaper local brands, are among the
barriers cited in the study for the patients’
poor access to insulin.

</sent><sent id="dtb8" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp9">For this study, researchers surveyed the
insulin products sold in select pharmacies
in Delhi and interviewed private-sector
insulin retailers and wholesalers. </sent><sent id="dtb9" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp10">They
found that Indian doctors do not trust
local products and believe that insulin
from foreign companies is better. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp11" id="dtb10">Only
25% of surveyed pharmacies stocked
Indian brands — a ﬁnding the study says is
a sign of “public health failure.”

</sent><sent id="dtb11" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp12">Recombinant human insulins have been
produced since 19805 using genetically
modiﬁed microbes. </sent><sent id="dtb12" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp13">“Analogue” insulin,
an altered form of recombinant insulin
and 5-9 times costlier, came into the
market over the past decade. </sent><sent id="dtb13" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp14">Wholesalers

prescribing “analogues” made by foreign
companies. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp17" id="dtb15">“Of the ﬁve wholesalers we
interviewed, only one supplied insulin
products made by Indian companies,”
Sharma told Nature India.

</sent><sent id="dtb16" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp18">The inclusion of analogue insulin on the
Delhi Essential Medicines List is, in part,
driving the transition to increased uptake
of analogue insulins which are foreign-made and not produced by any Indian
company, says the study.

</sent><sent id="dtb17" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp19">The study found that some multinational
insulin manufacturers, Indian doctors and
even wholesalers are selling insulin directly
to patients, cutting out pharmacies. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp20" id="dtb18">This
may force pharmacists “to either not
stock insulin at all, or stock mostly more
expensive insulins “further reducing
patients’ accessibility to insulin because of
the cost factor”, the authors report.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp21" id="dtb19">The study found that several pharmacists
only stocked insulins made by foreign
companies because those were the ones
prescribed by doctors Who “often engage
in exploitative practices with the motive of
earning proﬁts.”

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp22" id="dtb20">This is an “indictment on the weak
Indian medicine regulatory agency” and
testimony to the marketing power of
multinationals, the report says. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp23" id="dtb21">“All this, of
course, exacerbates the public health risk
with regard to access and availability of
quality assured, domestic insulins.”

</sent><sent id="dtb22" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp24">The Delhi study found that insulin
market is dominated mainly by three
foreign companies —— Novo Nordisk, Eli
Lilly and Sanoﬁ Aventis. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp25" id="dtb23">“A few Indian
companies do supply recombinant human
insulin but their market shares are small
and diminishing,” the report says.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp26" id="dtb24">The global market dominance by a
few companies will likely continue even
though patents on the current portfolio of
insulin analogs will expire very soon, says

the report. </sent><sent id="dtb26" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp29">“Increasing competition from
Indian companies is going to require some
additional policies, not presently in place.”

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp30" id="dtb27">Both the government and pharmacy
associations should work with stakeholders
to better align the ﬁnancial incentives
of those in the insulin supply chain
and promote local brands, the authors
conclude. </sent><sent id="dtb28" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp31">“To eliminate mistrust about
Indian insulin, its efﬁcacy and safety must
be compared with imported products and
the results made public.”

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp32" id="dtb29">“A practical way forward would be to
ﬁnd potential generic manufacturers and
nudge them towards opportunities to
diversify their national insulin markets
with acceptable off—patent products for
export,” the authors suggest.
