The primary goal of classical yoga is to bring
concentration and stillness to
the mind. </sent><sent id="dtb5" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp6">A focused mind and a
peaceful and positive feeling, are vital requirements as well
as by-products of an effective
asana practice. </sent><sent id="dtb6" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp7">Yoga should not
be for the body alone. </sent><sent id="dtb7" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp8">Mental
focus as part of asana practice
is an entrée to the meditation
that follows the asanas. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp9" id="dtb8">Without mental focus, asanas are
just an exercise for the body;
the mind is disengaged and
vagrant.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp10" id="dtb9">Such an asana practice will
not effectively lead to meditation. </sent><sent id="dtb10" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp11">Practising the true aim of
yoga - to calm and control the
mind - does not require a
knowledge of Sanskrit. </sent><sent id="dtb11" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp12">Being
familiar with many Sanskrit
names, such as those for yoga
postures does not, in and of itself, indicate that a person is
practising authentic yoga.
</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp13" id="dtb12">Proper understanding of the
principles and practice of yoga
is more important. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp14" id="dtb13">The fundamentals of the practice of yoga
came to us many centuries ago
in the Sanskrit language. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp15" id="dtb14">But
the methods and beneﬁts of the
practice transcend language
and culture.

</sent><sent id="dtb15" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp16">This raises the issue of naming asanas in order to practise
them. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp17" id="dtb16">The Caraka Samhita - the classical work on Ayurveda
(traditional Indian medicine) - advises the healer not to despair if a name cannot be assigned to every disorder 
encountered; treatment can still be administered. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp18" id="dtb17">As yoga practitioners and teachers, we can
follow this advice: “We do not
have to name each of the numerous variations of classical asanas, in Sanskrit or in any other
language, to practise them.”

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp19" id="dtb18">Many variations of asanas
are easier practised or described

 than named — especially in Sanskrit. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp22" id="dtb20">What's in a
name? </sent><sent id="dtb21" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp23">Yoga poses are named in
various ways. </sent><sent id="dtb22" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp24">Some are named
after animals and birds, some
describe the body's position in
an asana, and some are named
after mythological ﬁgures.
</sent><sent id="dtb23" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp25">Some asanas are named after
ancient sages or derive from
mythology, with uplifting stories behind them. </sent><sent id="dtb24" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp26">For instance,
Bharadvajasana is named after
the sage Bharadvaja; visvamitrasana is named after the sage Visvamitra.

</sent><sent id="dtb25" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp27">Bhagiratasana is another. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp28" id="dtb26">It
is widely known as “tree pose”
(vrkshasana). </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp29" id="dtb27">My guru, the legendary Yogi of the last century, T. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp30" id="dtb28">Krishnamacharya used to
call the tree pose Bhagiratasana. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp31" id="dtb29">Bhagirata was supposed to
have meditatedf for several
years standing on one leg!
</sent><sent id="dtb30" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp32">Krishnamacharya used to say,
“When doing Bhagiratasana,
keep the great Bhagirata inmind. </sent><sent id="dtb31" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp33">Bring tireless perseverance and steadfast concentration to your practice.”

</sent><sent id="dtb32" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp34">Consider the warrior pose,
Virabhadrasana. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp35" id="dtb33">This is an example of an asana name that
suggests the psychological feeling that can accompany the
practice. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp36" id="dtb34">Virabhadrasana is an
assertive stance that can produce an energetic feeling.
</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp37" id="dtb35">While doing the warrior Vinyasa, Krishnamacharya recommended that we bring into our
mind a feeling like that of a
bird. </sent><sent id="dtb36" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp38">This is particularly appropriate in the devotional tradition of Vaishnavism, in which a
principal devotee of the Divine,
in the form of Lord Narayana, is
depicted as an eagle named Garuda. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp39" id="dtb37">The eagle Garuda also
functions as a vehicle, bearing
Narayana on his back. </sent><sent id="dtb38" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp40">“As you
do the Virabhadrasana Vinyasa,” Krishnamacharya would say, “keep in mind that you are
in the service of the Divine. </sent><sent id="dtb39" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp41">As
you extend your arms and look
down, bring the feeling that
you are above the world and its
various concerns but close to
the Divine.”

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp42" id="dtb40">What if a practitioner has no
religious beliefs?

</sent><sent id="dtb41" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp43">Still, the imagery is valuable.
</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp44" id="dtb42">Instead of thinking of the Divine, a practitioner can bring
the feeling that ‘I am Without
any fear or burden. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp45" id="dtb43">I am not
troubled by the future or the
past, ﬂying above worldly pressures.’ </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp46" id="dtb44">In yoga, we work with
our minds to ensure that the internal results are in our hands.
