In the quest to make access to space cheaper, India successfully ﬂight tested
a scale model of its own version of
reusable space shuttle from Satish Dhawan
Space Center in Sriharikota, off the south-eastern coast, on May 23, 2016.

</sent><sent id="dtb5" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp6">Weighing 1.5 tons, about one-sixth the
actual size, the "technology demonstrator"
resembling a small winged aircraft, was
carried on a solid booster rocket to a
height of 65 km. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp7" id="dtb6">From there it began its
descent re-entering the atmosphere at ﬁve
times the speed of sound to land at a pre-
determined spot in the Bay of Bengal.

</sent><sent id="dtb7" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp8">"In this ﬂight, critical technologies such
as autonomous navigation, guidance
and control, reusable thermal protection
system and re—entry mission management
have been successfully validated," the
Indian Space Research Organization ISRO
said.

This is the ﬁrst of four test ﬂights
planned for validating technologies like
autonomous landing on land, powered
cruise ﬂight, and hypersonic ﬂight using
air—breathing propulsion, to be employed
in the Reusable launch Vehicle (RLV) that
ISRO hopes to develop in 10 years. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp11" id="dtb9">"We
still have a long way to go till we reach
the actual RLV," ISRO chairman A.S.Kiran Kumar had told reporters before the
launch.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp12" id="dtb10">The Rs. 950 million ($14 million)
program was conceived by ISRO in 2009.
</sent><sent id="dtb11" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp13">The ﬁrst test was planned for 2011 but got
postponed several times.
