GHMC, is in the process of
identifying dump sites for
depositing the construction
and demolition (CnD) waste,
from where the concessionaire for processing the
waste may transport the
same to the plants to be set
up in Jeedimetla and
Fathullahguda.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp6" id="dtb5">So far, a total of 30 spots
have been identiﬁed across
the city for this purpose, ofﬁcials have informed.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp7" id="dtb6">Identiﬁcation of such sites
assumes importance, as
CnD waste continues to be
dumped in the city lakes resulting in their shrinkage,
despite instructions to the
contrary and deployment of
exclusive vehicles for collection of CnD waste.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp8" id="dtb7">The Corporation has
launched 20 vehicles in December last for collection
and shifting of construction
debris wherever it is found.
</sent><sent id="dtb8" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp9">So far, more than 9000 metric tonnes of CnD waste has
been collected and shifted to
Jawaharnagar dump yard
and Jeedimetla sites. </sent><sent id="dtb9" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp10">"We
have been collecting waste
as indicated by Zonal Commissioners as, of now. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp11" id="dtb10">We
have convinced the Concessionaire Ramky Enviro Engineers to use part of the debris in capping the legacy
dump at Jawaharnagar," Additional COmmissioner looking after CnD operations N.Ravi Kiran said.

</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp12" id="dtb11">Lakes are one prominent
location to ﬁnd the demolition waste, as they still get illegally dumped with the
waste during nights. </sent><sent id="dtb12" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp13">Installation of CnD waste processing units at both the sites
may take six months more, as clearance by the State Pollution Control Board is awaited, he said.

 Each of the
two units will be installed
with the capacity to process
500 MT per day. </sent><sent id="dtb14" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp16">Though it is
estimated that the city generates about 500 MT of CnD
waste per day, ofﬁcials feel
that it is too premature to
guess unless they knew
where the debris was going.
</sent><sent id="dtb15" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp17">"We have reports that the
debris is being used for filling the basement of the
buildings, which is not advisable, " Mr. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp18" id="dtb16">Ravi Kiran said.

A report by the Centre for
Fly Ash Research And Management (C-FARM), New Delhi, in association with the
Building Materials and Technology Promotion Council
(BMTPC), pnts the daily generation of CnD waste in city
at 750 tannes. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp21" id="dtb18">The area to be
covered under Jeedimetla
and Fathullahguda plants
which will have the capacity
to process 500 tonnes is
216.5 sq.km. and 8535
sq. km., respectively. </sent><sent id="dtb19" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp22">Two
more plants will be set up
subsequently, to cover the
Whole city. </sent><sent id="dtb20" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp23">GHMC has
awarded the collection,
transportation, treatment and disposal of CnD waste to
Ramky under public-private-partnership mode for 25
years. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp24" id="dtb21">Tipping fee of Rs342 per MT will be collected for
the same. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp25" id="dtb22">Proposal is to collect the fee from the developers when they come for
building clearances.
