Reader (Read-Aloud) Accommodation

disability that is two or more grade-levels below the student’s enrollment grade
and that severely limits the student from decoding at any level of difﬁculty.

0 Reading two or more grade-levels below current enrollment grade

student should be working toward mastery of those deﬁcit skills. </sent><sent id="dtb25" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp30">The criteria for

MORNING

There is a pile of clothing on the side
of the train tracks. </sent><sent id="dtb28" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp34">Light-blue cloth—
a shirt, perhaps—jumbled up with
something dirty white. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp35" id="dtb29">It’s probably
rubbish, part of a load dumped into
the scrubby little wood up the bank. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp36" id="dtb30">It
could have been left behind by the en-
gineers who work this part of the
track, they’re here often enough. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp37" id="dtb31">Or it
could be something else. </sent><sent id="dtb32" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp38">My mother

can’t help it, I catch sight ofthese dis—
carded scraps, a dirty T-shirt or a
lonesome shoe, and all I can think of
is the other shoe and the feet that ﬁt—
ted into them.

</sent><sent id="dtb33" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp39">The train jolts and scrapes and
screeches back into motion, the little
pile of clothes disappears from View
and we trundle on towards London,
moving at a briskjogger’s pace. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp40" id="dtb34">Some-
one in the seat behind me gives a sigh
of helpless irritation; the 8:04 slow
train from Ashbury to Euston can test
the patience of the most seasoned
commuter. </sent><sent id="dtb35" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp41">The journey is supposed
to take ﬁfty—four minutes, but it rarely
does: this section of the track is an-
cient, decrepit, beset with signalling
problems and never—ending engineer—
ing works.

CHAPTER I. </sent><sent id="dtb262" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp311">Down the Rabbit-Hole

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped
into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,‘ thought Alice
'without pictures or conversation?</sent><sent id="dtb263" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp312">‘

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for
the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the
pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of
getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit
with pink eyes ran close by her.

</sent><sent id="dtb264" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp313">There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think
it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh
dear! </sent><sent id="dtb265" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp314">Oh dear! </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp315" id="dtb266">I shall be Iate!</sent><sent smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp316" id="dtb267">‘ (when she thought it over
afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at
this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the
Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT—POCKET,
and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for
it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit
with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and
fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hoIe
under the hedge.

</sent><sent id="dtb268" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp317">In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
considering how in the world she was to get out again.

</sent><sent id="dtb269" smilref="speechgen0002.smil#tcp318">The rabbit-hoIe went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and
then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a
moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
falling down a very deep well.
