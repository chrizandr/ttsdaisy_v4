CHAPTER I. </a>

            <span class="sentence" id="dtb262">
               <a href="speechgen0002.smil#text311">Down the Rabbit-Hole

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped
into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,‘ thought Alice
'without pictures or conversation?</a>
            </span>
            <span class="sentence" id="dtb263">
               <a href="speechgen0002.smil#text312">‘

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for
the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the
pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of
getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit
with pink eyes ran close by her.

</a>
            </span>
            <span class="sentence" id="dtb264">
               <a href="speechgen0002.smil#text313">There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think
it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh
dear! </a>
            </span>
            <span class="sentence" id="dtb265">
               <a href="speechgen0002.smil#text314">Oh dear! </a>
            </span>
            <span class="sentence" id="dtb266">
               <a href="speechgen0002.smil#text315">I shall be Iate!</a>
            </span>
            <span class="sentence" id="dtb267">
               <a href="speechgen0002.smil#text316">‘ (when she thought it over
afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at
this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the
Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT—POCKET,
and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for
it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit
with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and
fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hoIe
under the hedge.

</a>
            </span>
            <span class="sentence" id="dtb268">
               <a href="speechgen0002.smil#text317">In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
considering how in the world she was to get out again.

</a>
            </span>
            <span class="sentence" id="dtb269">
               <a href="speechgen0002.smil#text318">The rabbit-hoIe went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and
then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a
moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
falling down a very deep well.
